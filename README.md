Simple Java Chatroom
The main purpose of this project is to familiarize programming concepts and learn more about
various Java libraries that I haven't used much in my time using the language. This includes
the various types of I/O, Swing GUI, Networking, Graphics, and perhaps JDBC. I plan on implementing the following features in the end, taking much inspiration from current
chatting programs such as AOL or Facebook Messenger into mind.

1. A Client GUI to allow users to chat with each other over a network.
2. The ability to send both text and images between users.
3. The ability to keep some sort of profile data such as a profile picture and a name.

Possible Future Goals.
1. Games that could be played through the chatrooms, example would be the tic tac toe program that I have included in my git.
2. Ability to send simplistic drawings through to other users.
3. Persistance layer, the ability to link user data to a database.
